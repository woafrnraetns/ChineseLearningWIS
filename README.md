# Chinese Learning WIS

Welcome to the Chinese Learning Group repository at WIS! This repository serves as a hub for our weekly meetings where we study materials from the HSK textbook as well as custom resources curated by our teacher. Here, you'll find comprehensive notes and materials from our past sessions. Join us in our language-learning journey and explore the rich content within this repository.
